<h2 style="text-align: center;"> 🚀 Data/ML Engineer 🤖 | 👨‍🔧 Pipeline Architect | 🐍 Python/Analytics Enthusiast 📊 </h2>
  
### About Me 👋

Hi, I'm Bayo.

I'm a passionate Data/ML Engineer with a knack for building robust, scalable data pipelines and turning raw data into actionable insights. With years of experience in the field, I've worked on projects ranging from real-time streaming analytics to large-scale batch processing systems. My expertise extends to machine learning, where I've implemented ML pipelines and deployed models at scale, bridging the gap between data engineering and data science.

### Learning 🌱

I'm always excited to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data engineering. Currently, I'm focusing on:

+ **Generative AI**: Exploring applications of generative models in data pipelines and analytics
+ **MLOps**: Implementing best practices for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production
+ **Graph Databases**: Learning Neo4j for handling complex, interconnected data
+ **Data Mesh Architecture**: Studying decentralized data management approaches

### Projects 🔭

**Real-time Data Processing Pipeline with Spark Streaming**

+ Developed a robust real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Spark Streaming and Kafka
+ Ingested high-volume streaming data from IoT devices and processed it in real-time
+ Implemented windowed operations and stateful transformations to analyze time-series data
+ Utilized Spark SQL for complex aggregations and Delta Lake for reliable storage
+ Deployed the pipeline on AWS EMR for scalability and cost-effectiveness

**Data Warehouse Optimization**

+ Designed and implemented a star schema data model for a large-scale data warehouse
+ Optimized query performance by creating appropriate indexes and partitioning strategies
+ Reduced query execution time by 60% through careful schema design and query tuning

**ETL Pipeline Automation**

+ Built an automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to process daily batches of data
+ Integrated multiple data sources and implemented data quality checks
+ Reduced manual intervention by 87% and improved data freshness
