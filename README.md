### About Me 👋
Hi, I'm Bayo.

🚀 Data/ML Engineer 🤖 | 👨‍🔧 Pipeline Architect | 🐍 Python/Analytics Enthusiast 📊

I'm a passionate Data/ML Engineer with a knack for building robust, scalable data pipelines and turning raw data into actionable insights. With years of experience in the field, I've worked on projects ranging from real-time streaming analytics to large-scale batch processing systems. My expertise extends to machine learning, where I've implemented ML pipelines and deployed models at scale, bridging the gap between data engineering and data science.

### Learning 🌱

I'm always excited to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data engineering. Currently, I'm focusing on:

+ **Generative AI**: Exploring applications of generative models in data pipelines and analytics
+ **MLOps**: Implementing best practices for deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production
+ **Graph Databases**: Learning Neo4j for handling complex, interconnected data
+ **Data Mesh Architecture**: Studying decentralized data management approaches
